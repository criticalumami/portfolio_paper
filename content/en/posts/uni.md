#### Contingencies

In extrapolating common themes that are so hegemonic in academia I’ve decided to present a counter-approach.

First I looked at the distribution of public higher education locations within the city of Beirut, namely faculties and offices of the Lebanese University, I’ve overlapped major mass transit routes to the map and concluded two major findings:

- The Lebanese University is pushed the furthest away from the administrative borders of Beirut.
Bus/Van line number 4 is the most used route in the greater Beirut area, it goes from the LU in the southern suburb all the way to Fransabank in the buzzing Hamra street.
- The Bachoura neighborhood sits close to this busy line, and this is exactly where I propose to build a student union right in the heart of Beirut Central District adjoining the Beirut Digital District project.

The project is extremely simple is a facility that serves students in their housing, research and leisure needs:
- Very little space is allocated to car parking in the underground, students especially at LU tend to not own private automobiles.
- The ground floor is where communal life is organized: cafeteria, libraries and auditoriums.
- The upper floors are where modular housing units for students are distributed.
- The whole edifice is built around a central void serving as a stairwell.
