I was contacted by a dear friend of mine in the corona era, asking me if I would be interested in working on a renovation of a historical building in North Carolina USA, for a friend of his who had bought the plot.

Having never dealt with the intricacies of North American construction before I was eager to take the challenge.

The plot includes an early 20th century building that was to be renovated by North American experts in the matters for its interior, however I was tasked with collaborating with this team and the city in order to organize the exterior landscaping, decking and parking areas for the project.
