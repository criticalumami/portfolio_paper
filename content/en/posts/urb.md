ALBA had launched the competition for the extension of its Dekwaneh university and was starting to test the grounds on its students by proposing a design of a suburban housing unit that would include student housing and apartments for sale.

The major hurdle of the project was dealing with the adjoining Dekwaneh neighborhood that became like family for most of the institution.

A lesser one was the contradiction in building where a huge swampy green space provided fresh air for this industrial parts of the city.
My design was a compromise, a forest facing the neighborhood of Dekwaneh and a high-density horizontal edifice containing the development.

(Today the whole swamp is gone and a major business center took its place)
