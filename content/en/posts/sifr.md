### Overview

This project started with a previously recorded multi-episode podcast about political economy in the Arab world, I've been contacted to archive the whole audio data content and create a systematic way to produce social media content for the re-release of the episodes on the "sifr" platform. 

Being presented with hours upon hours of recorded audio data I've had to find a way to be able to search through the content in a thematic way, my first attempt was through the "openAI" with the "whisper" library, this is a machine learning algorithm developed by openAI that enables its user to time-tag and transliterate vast amount of audio datum in order to create a text based dataset that could get queried on the fly. This was the first time
