### On Prospects

During the graduate years students of architecture are given for the first time the task to elaborate a problematic and present a contribution to the body of academic knowledge. This was the perfect occasion to revisit the pedagogical theory that oversees the forming of thousands of architects in Lebanon.

I've always been intrigued by the geography of the Beirut Central District, I have lived most of my life close to the center of the city yet I my visits to the area were scarce. I've been reading the works of [Neil Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Smith_(geographer)) on the Rent-Gap theory, his idea was simple it postulated that capital is attracted geographically to specific dilapidated areas that are close to geographies with high rent, this is the basic idea of gentrification. 

We happen to have a perfect case-study for this phenomena in Beirut; the [Beirut Digital District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut_Digital_District), a multi-plot high-end real estate development project situated in one of the poorest areas of central Beirut, an area that is also very close to BCD which offers a plethora of empty plots.

BDD was on the other side of the ring, and this was what made the project so profitable. This reflexion led me to work on the periphery of BCD, studying the linear border that separates geographies both physical and social.

Regarding the submission of previously presented documents we adopted a two-fold approach to the problematic we first envisaged the structure of the current state of events followed by a reconsideration of our previous assesment in the non-sensical.

For these matters to be reassesed we were facing major political obstacles within the dynamics of our close-knit group e nwant to emphasis the importance of the bionese approach to group politics, this first goes hand in hand with the reconsideration of the whole environement previously layed bare by our dynmics and our
