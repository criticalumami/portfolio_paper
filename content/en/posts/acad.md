#### On the drive

During the graduate years students of architecture are given for the first time the task to elaborate a problematic and present a contribution to the body of academic knowledge. This was the perfect occasion to revisit the pedagogical theory that oversees the forming of thousands of architects in Lebanon.

I've always been intrigued by the geography of the Beirut Central District, I have lived most of my life close to the center of the city yet I my visits to the area were scarce. I've been reading the works of [Neil Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Smith_(geographer)) on the Rent-Gap theory, his idea was simple that postulated that capital is attracted geographically to specific dilapidated areas that are close to geographies with high rent, this is the basic idea of gentrification. 

We happen to have a perfect case-study for this phenomenon in Beirut; the [Beirut Digital District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut_Digital_District), a multi-plot high-end real estate development project situated in one of the poorest areas of central Beirut, an area that is also very close to BCD which offers a plethora of empty plots.

#### On Methodology

BDD was on the other side of the ring, and this was what made the project so profitable. This reflection led me to work on the periphery of BCD, studying the linear border that separates geographies both physical and social.

The methodology outlined above was extended to include several additional layers of cartographic analysis:

- Built environment ratios
- Urban density
- Car infrastructure connections
- Administrative boundaries
- Topography
- Pedestrian networks
- Ground floor usage
- Green density

This systematic and “linearized” approach produced a graphic format in which discrepancies within the urban fabric became clearly visible. It also allowed us to refine our analytical focus in selecting an area—and later a specific plot—that best exemplifies the spatial conflicts resulting from the development of the Beirut Central District (BCD).

What follows is a linear representation, situated between a map and a chart, which will serve as a guiding framework throughout the remainder of the project.

#### On Specificity

We have previously specified the southern part of the ring rift as our specific object of study, as the “linear cartography“ shows several enticing problematics:

- Heavy presence of infrastructure that morphologically hinders pedestrian flow between the banks.
Vast areas of unbuilt plots on the banks of the rift.
- Major administrative and business areas adjoining working class informal neighborhoods.

Parts of my study was dedicated to the question of pedestrian transit and soft mobility within the city, Beirut is car-centric true, real estate value is high, true, but there are many unpitched spatial volumes in and around major car infrastructure, I propose new ways to readapt and use these urban voids through the organization of pedestrian life around them.

But back to our main concern, the architectural practices in academia. The figure on the lower right represents the legal extent that any future building can occupy (I’ve only studied empty plots or ones that could be demolished).

This density is dictated by law of course but this is also a perfect occasion to revisit the works of Tom Slater and Hisham Achkar, these ratios are first and foremost there to enable developers to maximize profits, only second thoughts are given to the actual effectiveness of high density in these urban areas.
