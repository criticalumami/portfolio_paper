### Overview & Beginnings

The **Sustainable Integrated Municipal Action (SIMA)** launched by [UNOPS](https://lebanon.un.org/en/227264-unops-launches-two-call-proposals-lebanon), aims to support Lebanese regional authorities—namely municipalities—by providing funding and management assistance for various sustainable initiatives across the country.

I was contacted by the urban planning team working with UNOPS to contribute to the architectural and urban strategy consultancy under the SIMA **Street Network** subproject.

The objective of this effort was to reorganize and improve pedestrian accessibility within Beirut's administrative borders and its surrounding suburbs. The UNOPS project management team identified seven key sectors requiring study and reconnection:

- **S01** — [Yerevan Flyover, Bourj Hammoud](https://sima-yf.netlify.app)
- **S02** — Souk Trail, Bourj Hammoud
- **S03** — Railway Walk, Bourj Hammoud
- **S04** — Geitawi Neighborhood
- **S05** — Beirut Corniche
- **S06** — Damascus Road
- **S07** — [Cola Roundabout](https://sima-cr.netlify.app)

Throughout the project we worked with a team of engineers, architects, consultants and administrators to provide a holistic approach to pedestrian mobility in the city.

### Data Collection

I was first tasked with reviewing existing literature and previously planned projects that touch on pedestrian mobility and mass transit in Beirut and Bourj Hammoud, while these projects were easily accessible raw geographical information was scarce and hard to access.

Thus after conducting an extensive review of previous projects and literature on soft mobility in Beirut, we surveyed the identified sites and cross-referenced our findings with two major datasets: the [Beirut Urban Lab at the American University of Beirut](https://beiruturbanlab.com/) and the [Neighborhood Project dataset from UN-Habitat](https://lebanonportal.unhabitat.org). This enabled us to develop our initial cartographic outputs, providing a clear representation of current on-the-ground conditions.

Additionally, we carried out detailed topographical surveys of all seven sectors and captured 360-degree video footage of the entire street network.

You can view an example of this cartography here: [S05 — Beirut Corniche](/img/sima_1_bc.pdf).

### Design Brief

Following an in-depth site analysis and a comprehensive review of existing studies and projects related to soft mobility in Beirut and its suburbs, we identified several core challenges hindering pedestrian mobility in the city. To address these, we adopted a three-pronged vectors of interventions:

- **Hardscape Interventions**
- **Tactical Urban Interventions**
- **Administrative & Operational Measures**

Securing adequate funding was a major hurdle throughout this process. Our goal was to maximize impact with limited resources to reinvigorate Beirut’s pedestrian infrastructure:

- This phase introduced additional key cartographic layers that spatially identified potential areas of intervention, ensuring that our efforts would have maximum impact. Our hardscape interventions focused on enhancing sidewalks to facilitate smooth pedestrian movement through major transit nodes — primarily along formal and informal mass transit routes mapped during the previous data collection phase.

- In parallel, we also explored temporary or short-term measures inspired by the principles of tactical urbanism. These interventions are designed to maximize the use of public spaces without requiring long-term capital investment in permanent infrastructure. By allowing for flexible and adaptable changes, tactical urbanism creates opportunities for the urban environment to evolve organically in response to shifting needs and conditions.

- Finally this phase also saw frequent consultations with local and regional stakeholders in order the assess both the feasibility of our proposals as well as the reaction of local communities and their participation in the design process.

### Concept Design

Once potential sites of intervention and networks of pedestrian movement were drawn we embarked on the design of actual spatial concepts for the different sections. We followed the previously elaborated matrix to develop localized solutions for each section as well as a systematic design approach for dealing with sidewalks and urban furniture.

This is where the whole project comes together bridging previous analytical works with on-the-ground design methods and procurement means.

### Detailed Design

Finally execution drawings were put together, I had to manage a team of architects in the drawing phase and coordinate with the engineers and administrative authorities.

A major challenge of this phase was my role as a coordinator between project management i.e UNOPS, the engineering firm Kredo and the architects at Akl Architects.
