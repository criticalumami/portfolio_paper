### Overview & Beginnings

The Sustainable Integrated Municipal Action (SIMA) project launched by [UNOPS](https://lebanon.un.org/en/227264-unops-launches-two-call-proposals-lebanon) aims to facilitate the work of Lebanese regional authorities i.e municipalities in providing project funding and management to several sustainable projects on the national soil.

I was contact by the urban planning team working with UNOPS to contribute to the architectural and urban strategy consulting effort under the banner of the SIMA - Street Network subproject.

The aim of the endeavor was to reorganize pedestrian accessibility within the boundaries of the city of Beirut and its suburbs. The project management team at UNOPS presented to us 7 sectors of interest that ought to be studied and reconnected namely:

- S01 - Yerevan Flyover BH 
- S02 - Souk Trail BH
- S03 - Railway Walk BH
- S04 - Geitawi Neighborhood
- S05 - Beirut Corniche
- S06 -  Damascus Road
- S07 - Cola Roundabout

Pedestrian infrastructure and soft mobility networks were to be reorganized with the aim of giving access to mobility to those who are left on the margins of car-centric policy.
### Data Collection

The major issue with data collection in our geographies resided in the lack of publicly available datasets that are moderated and maintained by local authorities, most of our informations are sourced from private institutions (often higher education) and international non-governmental organizations.

After a thorough review of previously published projects and literature on soft-mobility in Beirut we surveyed the sites and cross-referenced our findings with two major datasets, the first one from the [Beirut Urban Lab at the American University of Beirut](https://beiruturbanlab.com/) and the second from the [Neighborhood Project dataset from UN Habitat](https://lebanonportal.unhabitat.org). This resulted in the first cartography production that lays bare the current situation on the ground.

Here is a cartography sample from [S05 - Beirut Corniche](/img/sima_1_bc.pdf).
