### Overview & Beginnings

The Sustainable Integrated Municipal Action (SIMA) project launched by [UNOPS](https://lebanon.un.org/en/227264-unops-launches-two-call-proposals-lebanon) aims to facilitate the work of Lebanese regional authorities i.e municipalities in providing project funding and management to several sustainable projects on the national soil.

I was contact by the urban planning team working with UNOPS to contribute to the architectural and urban strategy consulting effort under the banner of the SIMA - Street Network subproject.

The aim of the endeavor was to reorganize pedestrian accessibility within the boundaries of the city of Beirut and its suburbs. The project management team at UNOPS presented to us 7 sectors of interest that ought to be studied and reconnected namely:
- S01 - Yerevan Flyover BH
- S02 - Souk Trail BH
- S03 - Railway Walk BH
- S04 - Geitawi Neighborhood
- S05 - Beirut Corniche
- S06 -  Damascus Road
- S07 - Cola Roundabout
Pedestrian infrastructure and soft mobility networks were to be reorganized with the aim of giving access to mobility to those who are left on the margins of car-centric policy.

#### Site Inspection & Data Collection

How could I ignore this encroachment, when I have for decades witnessed the calculated planning advancing upon my nation and homeland from every direction, achieving all—or at least some—of what it wants, day after day and year after year? That is why I have never picked up the pen without firmly believing I carry a responsibility: either I fulfill it properly, or I crush this pen beneath my feet without regret for it or for myself.

This transformation addresses not only infrastructure but also the cultural and social implications of reclaiming public space. By enhancing pedestrian access and comfort, these interventions encourage community interaction, reduce traffic congestion, and foster sustainable mobility for future generations.
