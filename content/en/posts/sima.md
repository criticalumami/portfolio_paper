### Overview & Beginnings

The **Sustainable Integrated Municipal Action (SIMA)** project, launched by [UNOPS](https://lebanon.un.org/en/227264-unops-launches-two-call-proposals-lebanon), aims to support Lebanese regional authorities—namely municipalities—by providing funding and management assistance for various sustainable initiatives across the country.

I was contacted by the urban planning team working with UNOPS to contribute to the architectural and urban strategy consultancy under the SIMA **Street Network** subproject.

The objective of this effort was to reorganize and improve pedestrian accessibility within Beirut and its surrounding suburbs. The UNOPS project management team identified seven key sectors requiring study and reconnection:

- **S01** — Yerevan Flyover, Bourj Hammoud
- **S02** — Souk Trail, Bourj Hammoud
- **S03** — Railway Walk, Bourj Hammoud
- **S04** — Geitawi Neighborhood
- **S05** — Beirut Corniche
- **S06** — Damascus Road
- **S07** — Cola Roundabout

The overarching goal was to reorganize pedestrian infrastructure and soft mobility networks to ensure accessible mobility for communities often excluded by car-centric urban policies.

### Data Collection

A significant challenge in our context is the lack of publicly available datasets that are actively maintained by local authorities. Much of our information comes from private institutions (primarily academic) and international non-governmental organizations.

After conducting an extensive review of previous projects and literature on soft mobility in Beirut, we surveyed the identified sites and cross-referenced our findings with two major datasets: the [Beirut Urban Lab at the American University of Beirut](https://beiruturbanlab.com/) and the [Neighborhood Project dataset from UN-Habitat](https://lebanonportal.unhabitat.org). This enabled us to develop our initial cartographic outputs, providing a clear representation of current on-the-ground conditions.

Additionally, we carried out detailed topographical surveys of all seven sectors and captured 360-degree video footage of the entire street network.

You can view an example of this cartography here: [S05 — Beirut Corniche](/img/sima_1_bc.pdf).

### Design Brief & Key Challenges

Following an in-depth site analysis and a comprehensive review of existing studies and projects related to soft mobility in Beirut and its suburbs, we identified several core challenges hindering pedestrian mobility in the city. To address these, we adopted a three-pronged approach:

- **Hardscape Interventions**
- **Tactical Urban Interventions**
- **Administrative & Operational Measures**

Securing adequate funding was a major hurdle throughout this process. Our goal was to maximize impact with limited resources to reinvigorate Beirut’s pedestrian infrastructure.

### Concept Design

At this stage, our ideas began to take shape. We mapped potential suppliers for essential materials and developed preliminary strategies for implementation.

---

### Detailed Design

The detailed design phase focused on producing precise technical drawings and specifications for key urban elements, such as benches and other street furniture, to guide procurement and installation.

---

### Moving Forward

The next steps will involve refining these designs, securing additional funding, and coordinating with stakeholders to ensure the sustainable implementation and maintenance of the proposed pedestrian network improvements.
