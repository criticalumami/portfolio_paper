# Resume Improvement Suggestions

Here's a breakdown of suggestions for improving your resume, based on the text content provided. Since the resume is a PDF, these are recommendations for you to implement in your source document.

---

### General Observations & Overall Structure:

*   **Visual Layout:** The current two-column layout is common. Ensure there's enough whitespace, especially around sections and between bullet points, to prevent it from looking too dense. The current font (Courier New) is legible but can sometimes appear less "modern" or professional than other sans-serif options. Consider a more contemporary, clean sans-serif font like Lato, Open Sans, or Montserrat for better readability and a modern feel.
*   **"Selected" Tags:** You have `[selected]` next to some entries (e.g., "Freelance / Architecture - Urban Planning – Design," "OJ Arch / Senior Architect," "Studio Miessen / Junior Architect"). If this is for your internal use, remove it from the final resume. If it's meant to indicate a portfolio piece, consider a more professional way to convey that, perhaps by linking to a portfolio or noting it in a cover letter.

### Contact Information:

*   **Clarity:** Your contact information is clear. Good to have email and phone.
*   **Location:** "Beirut, Lebanon" is good.
*   **Portfolio/LinkedIn:** Consider adding a link to your online portfolio or LinkedIn profile if you have one. This is crucial for architects to showcase work.

### Education:

*   **Conciseness:** This section is well-formatted and concise. No major changes needed here.
*   **Dates:** Consistent date format.

---

### Skills:

*   **Categorization:** This section is well-categorized, which makes it easy to scan.
*   **"MS Office":** While common, you might consider listing specific programs if they are highly relevant (e.g., Excel for data analysis, PowerPoint for presentations).
*   **"Adobe Suite":** Similar to MS Office, if specific programs like Photoshop, Illustrator, or InDesign are critical to your architectural work, list them individually.
*   **"QGIS" and "SketchUp Plugins":** Good to see specific software and tools relevant to your field.
*   **Language Proficiency:** The `(Native)`, `(Fluent)`, `(B1)` notations are clear and professional.

### Experience:

This is the most crucial section. Focus on **quantifiable achievements** and **strong action verbs**.

### Key Takeaways for Improvement:

1.  **Quantify Everything Possible:** Numbers, percentages, and specific outcomes make your achievements concrete and impressive. Even if you have to estimate, try to add some scale.
2.  **Strong Action Verbs:** Start every bullet point with a powerful action verb (e.g., Led, Managed, Designed, Developed, Coordinated, Analyzed, Implemented, Optimized, Directed).
3.  **Focus on Results/Impact:** Instead of just describing tasks, explain the *outcome* or *benefit* of your work. What problem did you solve? What value did you add?
4.  **Tailor to the Job:** When applying for specific roles, customize your resume to highlight the most relevant experiences and skills for that particular job description.
