      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;on-the-prospect-of-reconversion&#34;&gt;On the prospect of reconversion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first instance of our reconversion we had decided to reconvene the meeting and throw it back to the second line in command to inspect and attend to the other matters that are more pressing, we thus managed periodically a thorough analysis of the current situation especially after the coming war&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also why we weren&amp;rsquo;t able to reconsider previous chapters of the current contractions, we will thus try and reconfigure the whole study in a manner that appeals to the less versed in the aspects of tpolitical entaglement in the city of beirut and more globally in the levantine and south levantine area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Analytical maps for the rehabilitation of the pedestrian network in the Cola area, central Beirut. The main public transportation hub was studied and transformed into a pedestrian- and soft mobility-friendly zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could I ignore this encroachment, when I have for decades witnessed the calculated planning advancing upon my nation and homeland from every direction, achieving all—or at least some—of what it wants, day after day and year after year? That is why I have never picked up the pen without firmly believing I carry a responsibility: either I fulfill it properly, or I crush this pen beneath my feet without regret for it or for myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
